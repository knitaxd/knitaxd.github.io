## My process

Was my first time using the mobile-first workflow and i really love it. The challenge was so hard but finally i solved it, i had many questions and that help me a lot to learn new things. I know some things are not doing on the best way but this challenge doesn't finish here for me, my plan is to do better versions of this. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I take some recomendations on my last challenge, one of these recomendations was the use of semantic html, and a i did it, maybe is not the best, but i promise i'm going to do it better in the other versions and challenges.

Taking just couple of lines to talk about what i am proud is not fair because CSS and JavaScript are too hard, so the hole code (especially the cart functions) makes me feel so proud.

### Continued development

I want to improve the semantic html, furthermore i want to get use to add more grid to have facilites with the responsive web desing. About JavaScript i need to continue learning a lot on event listeners, POO and everything!

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_sidenav.asp) - This helped me a lot to do the side/nav bar responsive.
- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp) - This helped me a lot to do the slideshow and the lightbox too.

- [Udemy - Juan de la Torre](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-moderno-guia-definitiva-construye-10-proyectos/learn/lecture/21852556?start=0#overview) - This course helped me with the cart functions.
